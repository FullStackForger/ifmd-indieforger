# Marketing for Indiegame Developer
# Part 3: Launching the game

## Before the launch

Marketing is all about letting people about your game. It is also part of your job as indie game developer. So, **how to let people know about your game?** Before you answer that question, there are few extra steps you have to make.

### Important questions

First, there are some additional questions to be answered.
- Why is your game interesting and unique?
- What is so special about it?
- Why players should play your game?

### Marketing content

<!-- todo: move to earlier episodes  -->
As pointed out by Extra Credits, figuring out answer to those questions early in the process will help you, not only with promoting your game but also with making it much better experience for the players.

Once you have all the answer you can continue to the next step: preparing marketing content. There is a number of things you will need to put together: website, trailer, screenshots. But that's not all. You also need presence on social media. And yes... all of that have to be updated on regular basis.

We will not be covering all the details here.  It was all discussed in the previous article: [Part 2: Must-Have Checklist](part-2-must-have-checklist). Makes sure to read it.

### Building momentum

OK! You have all the answers and you ticked all the boxes on the list. Great! Back to original question.
**How to let people know about your game?** How do you get the word out?

- Reddit AMA (Ask me anything)
- Release updates (inform media every time you do it)

- No budget, with budget

## Release

When it comes to release of the game the most important is figuring out where your players are. Think about where you will find your audience. If you creating mobile game experience digital distribution platform might not be the best choice. On the other hand, you shouldn't rule that option out. If you can pass the Greenlight test, perhaps there are Steam players who will enjoy your game.

### Options

There are many different distribution channels, variety of platforms, systems and methods you can publish your game. So what are your options? In short, there are plenty! Each platform has own pros and cons. Lets run through most important of them.

### Porting

With that volume of possibilities you might be confused which one is the best for you. I am! Truth is, you should **release to as many platforms as possible**. Doing so will increase the amount of potential players you can reach.  
And this is why picking the right game engine, is so important. It is obviously little too late, if you half way through with the development. Just remember about it before you start next time. Go for the one that makes porting the game to different platforms as easy as possible. It will make your life easier as developer and, at the same time, will provide new opportunities to reach more players.

How to do it right? Which platform to go for first? If you have never released anything you might be tempted to pick the easiest one. Don't! It is the best to first target platforms where you believe you will find most of the audience for your game.

Also, you have to remember that with each platform you expose yourself to some platform specific configurations, settings and even more advanced adjustments. It also means more bugs to fix.

It is always good idea to target one platform at the time. Release, make sure game is stable and bug free if possible. Then, move onto the next one. Tackling one platform at the time, will reduce problems to deal with and less pressure on you as indie. Remember, development, in this case post-release bug fixing, will not be the only thing on your todo list.


## After the launch

So you did it. Your game is published. But, as you might suspect, it is not over yet. What next? Well, there is bug fixing, game updates, more marketing, listening to your players. Prepare yourself to be as busy after the release as you were just before. Good luck!
